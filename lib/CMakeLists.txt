# Add the following line in this CMakeLists.txt :
    # add_subdirectory(<package_name>)
# Copy an already existing package, rename it and include the .c files.
# Add the .h files in the "include" directory
# To name your newly created library, go to your package and
# modify the "LIB_NAME" variable
